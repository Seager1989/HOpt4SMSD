# HOpt4SMSD
This repository is a working repo for the Hyperparameter optimization of surrogate modeling for structural design (HOpt4SMSD) using machine learning algorithms: Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest regression (RFR), and artificial intelligent network (ANN).
