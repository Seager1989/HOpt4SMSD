This repository is a working repo for the Hyperparameter optimization of surrogate modeling for structural design (HOpt4SMSD) using machine learning algorithms: Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest regression (RFR), and artificial intelligent network (ANN).

(1)Pre-requisits:
   1) The R language version 3 is required.
   2) Several R packages are required ro run the codes: mlr and its required packages, mxnet, mlrMBO, readr, smoof;
